# MIST4610Project
## Problem Description
Our client has tasked us with modeling the internal database of their urgent medical care facility. The facility provides emergency services that do not require a trip to a hospital emergency room, as well as regular scheduled appointments to patients. The facility is regularly staffed by multiple physicians and nurses. Physicians may prescribe and administer medication, and patients may be covered by insurance and provide feedback on the service(s) they received. Our team’s objective is to design the relational database around these aspects of the client’s business, taking into account how each entity interacts with each other. The database is also meant to keep track of their day-to-day operations and provide useful insights into trends, demographics, and other analytics. 


# Queries
## Query 1
Calculate the total revenue generated by each insurance provider for a specific date range.

It provides insights into the financial performance of each provider during a set period, helping managers make informed decisions. By understanding which providers bring in the most revenue, managers can allocate resources effectively to meet patient needs.

## Query 4
This query retrieves a list of staff members (doctors and nurses) who have served more than 10 appointments, along with the total number of appointments they’ve served, and displays the results in descending order of the total appointments served.
### Justification
This query allows managers to assess the performance of staff members based on the number of appointments they are able to serve and provides insight into their workload and efficiency. By ordering the results in descending order of total appointments served, managers can easily identify the most active staff members and those who may require additional support.

## Query 5
This query retrieves a list of patients and their insurance providers, along with the name and contact information for both parties.
### Justification
Managers often need to have updated contact information for both patients and the insurance providers for said patients in order to keep track of administrative and billing responsibilities. This query allows managers to keep track of the contact details of both parties and provides managers with quick access to this information.
